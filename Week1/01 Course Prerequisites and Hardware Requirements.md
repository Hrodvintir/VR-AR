# Course Prerequisites and Hardware Requirements
Course Prerequisites and Hardware Requirements
This is one of three planned courses in Unity's XR Specialization, which will include courses focused on developing mobile VR and handheld AR applications with Unity. Although the later courses in the series require intermediate Unity programming skills, this course is designed to be accessible to anyone who is interested in XR technologies and is willing to roll up their sleeves, open Unity, and learn how to compile a basic application to a device. This can get technical - you'll need to install Unity and the appropriate software development kits and plug-ins - but this is all covered, step-by-step, in the project work.

This course also requires that you have a relatively recent smartphone and a Cardboard VR viewer for the VR and AR build projects.
