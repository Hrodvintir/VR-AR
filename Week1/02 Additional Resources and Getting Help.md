# Additional Resources and Getting Help
This course is packed with information about XR, and the project work can be challenging, but you're not alone! The Unity development community is famously welcoming and helpful. So if you find yourself stuck, don't hesitate to leverage these resources:

I have a question or comment about the course...

Course Discussion Forums - Coursera's message boards dedicated to this course. Post new questions about the material, and learn from the experiences of other students.

...and I want to chat with someone.

XR Specialization Channel on Connect - Connect is Unity's own community platform, and with the XR Specialization Channel you can message other channel members instantly. Connect is also a great place to share and get feedback on your project.

I need to know how something in Unity works...

If you're a Unity developer you know that the Unity Manual on XR has exhaustive information on Unity's XR APIs and hardware compatibility.

... and some example scripts would be great.

The Unity Scripting Reference provides documentation about Unity namespaces, classes, and methods, including extensive implementation examples.
