Instructions
Step 1 - Install the Vuforia SDK
Let's get the Vuforia SDK working in a new Unity project. If you already downloaded the Vuforia SDK as part of Unity installation, you may be able to skip some or all of these steps.

In Unity, create a new 3D Unity project

Select Edit > Project Settings > Player

In the XR Settings roll-out menu, click on Vuforia Augmented Reality. This will download the correct version of the SDK for your Unity editor.
