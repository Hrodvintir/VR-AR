# Project Work: Explore the VR Museum
**For this project work, you will:**
 - Explore the VR Museum application you built in a previous lesson

 - View demonstrations of different VR design principles in action

### Step 1 - Run the VR Museum application and have a look around
 - Relaunch the VR Museum application on your phone and put in a Cardboard viewer. We also recommend you use headphones to experience the app.

 - Notice that the main exhibit in the scene is a table with an avatar playing a game of ping pong in virtual reality. As you look around, notice that when you look at some things in the scene, a label pops up describing what that item represents.

 -Look around at all of the objects on the table so you're familiar with what they represent as we go through the four switches above the table.

### Step 2 - Activate the 3DOF/6DOF switch above the diorama and observe the results
 - Observe the starting state of the scene in the diorama. The scene starts out showing a 6DOF VR setup. There are two lighthouse sensors on the right, although it's possible some headsets would use inside out tracking and not require such lighthouses.

 - Look at the switch on the far left side of the panel above the diorama until the message "hold button to activate" appears. 

 - Press and hold down the button on your Google Cardboard device until a blue, circular timer appears and counts down fully. The scene on the table should switch to show a 3DOF setup instead of a 6DOF setup.

 - The main thing you'll notice is that the lighthouses disappear, but a less obvious change is that the virtual ping pong table now moves along with the real avatar. Switch between 3DOF and 6DOF a couple of times until you see what we're referring to. In 6DOF the ping pong table stays in the same virtual location while the user moves in physical space. The effect is that the user can "move around" the table. In 3DOF, the table is "stuck" to the avatar. The scene will rotate with the player's head, but will not respond to their other movement.

### Step 3 - Activate the Bright/Dim switch and observe the results
 - Look at the Bright/Dim toggle switch and hold the button to switch back and forth between the two.

 - This exhibit demonstrates how harsh lighting in VR can lead to user discomfort and a bad VR experience. Because the only lighting the user sees is coming from the VR headset and they can't look away to rest their eyes, eyestrain and fatigue in VR is even more important to consider than it is for general computer application design.

### Step 4 - Activate the Active/Sedate switch and observe the results
 - Look at the Active/Sedate switch and hold the button to toggle it.

 - In VR, and room scale in particular, there is a lot of physicality associated with many experiences that is not present in most computer apps. While this is great in terms of getting people moving more, it can also lead to fatigue and discomfort if you don't pace the amount of movement properly.

### Step 5 - Activate the Laggy/Smooth switch and observe the results
 - Look at the Laggy/Smooth switch and hold the button to toggle it.

 - Lag is probably the most important concern you should have as a VR developer. If your VR experience lags behind the users actual movements even a little, the user is likely to notice and feel nauseous. In a room scale situation, they could lose their balance and fall if your app skips frames or experiences momentary freezing.
